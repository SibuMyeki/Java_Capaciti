What is a variable?
A variable is a name given to a memory location. It is the basic unit of storage in a program. The value stored in a variable can be changed during program execution. A variable is only a name given to a memory location; all the operations done on the variable effects that memory location. In Java, all the variables must be declared before use.

How to declare variables?
"type": Type of data that can be stored in this variable = integer(int). "name": Name given to the variable = num. In this way, a name can only be given to a memory location. It can be assigned values in two ways:

Variable Initialization Assigning value by taking input EG BELOW

int num = 1;
value: It is the initial value stored in the variable.

Declaring variables examples:

float simpleInterest; - Declaring float variable
int myAge = 19; - Declaring and Initializing integer variable
char firstLetter = 'h'; - Declaring and Initializing character variable
There are three types of variables in Java:
Local Variables:
Local variables are declared within a specific method or block and exist only for the duration of that method or block.

void exampleMethod() {
    int localVar = 10; // localVar is a local variable
    // Other code here
}

Instance Variables:
Instance variables are declared in a class but outside any method. They exist as long as the object of the class exists. Example:

public class MyClass {
    int instanceVar; // instanceVar is an instance variable
}

Class (Static) Variables:
Class variables, declared with the static keyword, belong to the class rather than any particular instance. They are shared among all instances of the class. Example:

public class MyClass {
    static int classVar; // classVar is a class variable
}

These variable types serve different purposes in Java and have different scopes and lifetimes. Local variables are confined to a specific method, instance variables belong to an instance of a class, and class variables are shared among all instances of a class.
