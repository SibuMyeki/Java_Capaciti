Java is a programming language that allows developers to write instructions for computers. These instructions, written in Java, can run on different devices or systems, thanks to a special software called the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Java is known for its simplicity, versatility, and the ability to create software that works on various platforms.

Java Code (.java):
Java code is the source code that you write in the Java programming language. It's a human-readable text file with a .java extension. This code contains instructions that define how a Java program should behave.

// Simple program to add two numbers and sgowing syntax
public class AddNumbers {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int num1 = 5;
        int num2 = 10;
        int sum = num1 + num2;
        System.out.println("Sum: " + sum);
    }
}
